## Jenkins Pipeline Template for a Maven Java Project

This Jenkinsfile outlines a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Java application using Maven. It is structured into three primary stages: Build, Test, and Deploy, automating the process from code compilation to deployment.

### Jenkinsfile Content with Explanations

Copy the following pipeline script into a file named `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your Java Maven project repository. This script is ready to be used in a Jenkins pipeline job.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any // This specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent

    stages {
        stage('Build') { // The build stage cleans the project and packages the application
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package' // Executes Maven's clean and package phases
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') { // The test stage runs unit tests on the application
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test' // Executes Maven's test phase
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') { // The deploy stage is a placeholder for deployment operations
            steps {
                // This is where you would add scripts or commands to deploy your application
                echo 'Deploying application...' // Placeholder for deployment steps
                // Example: sh 'deploy-script.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Use

To implement this CI/CD pipeline for your Maven-based Java project in Jenkins:

1. **Set Up Your Jenkins Pipeline**:
   - Ensure Jenkins is installed and running.
   - Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - In the pipeline configuration, select "Pipeline script from SCM" to specify the source control management.
   - Enter the repository URL and credentials if necessary.
   - Specify the path to your `Jenkinsfile`.

2. **Customize the Deploy Stage**:
   - Modify the 'Deploy' stage in the `Jenkinsfile` to include actual deployment commands or scripts based on your deployment environment.

3. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Execute the pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Jenkins will check out your code and proceed through the Build, Test, and Deploy stages as defined.

4. **Verify the Pipeline Execution**:
   - After the pipeline runs, verify each stage's output in Jenkins to ensure the build, tests, and deployment (if configured) were successful.
