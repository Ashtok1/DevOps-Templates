## GitLab CI/CD Configuration for a Node.js Application

This `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline tailored for Node.js applications. The pipeline encompasses stages for building the application, running tests, and a placeholder for deployment scripts, ensuring automated execution upon every push to the repository.

### .gitlab-ci.yml Content with Explanations

Below is the content for the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, designed to automate the process for building, testing, and preparing a Node.js application for deployment. This configuration should be placed at the root of your Node.js project repository.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application..."
    - npm install # Installs project dependencies

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - npm run test # Executes unit tests

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the application..."
    # This is a placeholder for your deployment scripts.
    # Example: Uncomment and customize the following line for deployment
    # - scp -r * username@your-server:/path/to/deployment/
```

### How to Use

To utilize this CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js application in GitLab:

1. **Prepare Your `.gitlab-ci.yml`**:
   - Copy the provided `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration into the root directory of your Node.js project repository.

2. **Customize the Deploy Stage**:
   - Modify the `deploy_job` stage by adding actual deployment commands suited to your target environment. This might include scripts for deploying to a server, publishing to a cloud environment, or any other deployment mechanism your project requires.

3. **Push Changes to GitLab**:
   - Commit and push your changes, including the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, to your GitLab repository. GitLab CI/CD will automatically pick up the configuration and start the pipeline upon each push.

4. **Monitor Pipeline Execution**:
   - Navigate to the CI/CD section of your project in GitLab to monitor the pipeline's progress and troubleshoot any issues that arise during the build, test, or deploy stages.
